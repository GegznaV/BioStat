Title: Routines for Basic (Bio)Statistics
Description: A collection of functions that either are intended to be used with 
             R Commander plugin `RcmdrPlugin.biostat` or to do several common 
             statistical routines (without writing to much code). 
             The functions are created to complement other R Commander plugins 
             that can be used to teach basic statistics especially in 
             biostatistics and biometry lectures.
